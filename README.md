Welcome to my DevSecOps Portfolio! This repository is a collection of hands-on projects demonstrating my skills in development, security, and operations. Each project is designed to solve real-world problems, integrating secure coding practices, infrastructure automation, and vulnerability analysis. I created this portfolio to showcase my expertise for job applications in the DevSecOps field.

## About Me

I’m a passionate DevSecOps enthusiast with experience in:

- **Development**: Building applications with Python, PHP, and web technologies.
- **Security**: Identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities (e.g., cache poisoning, XSS).
- **Operations**: Automating infrastructure with Vagrant, Docker, and cloud-inspired designs.

This repo reflects my journey in mastering secure software delivery and operational efficiency.

## Projects

Below is a list of projects in this repository. Each has its own directory with a detailed `README.md` explaining the setup, usage, and learning outcomes.

| Project Name                  | Description                                      | Technologies           | Directory          |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| Cache Poisoning Lab           | A lab to exploit and secure cache poisoning vulnerabilities | Vagrant, Nginx, Varnish, HAProxy | [/cache-poisoning-lab](./1.Cache-Poisoning-Lab) |
| *(Add more projects here)*    | *(Description)*                                  | *(Tech stack)*         | *(Link)*           |

*More projects will be added as I continue to explore DevSecOps concepts.*

## Goals

- Demonstrate practical DevSecOps skills for job applications.
- Provide reusable, well-documented projects for learning and collaboration.
- Explore the intersection of development, security, and automation.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
